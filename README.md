# Purpose

The purpose of the project was to build a visual push/fold range chart controlled with slider/wheel scroll event to interact with the chart to study tournament poker.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Throughout the project I explored the use of Sass as a CSS preprocessor and programming using JS object orientation.


-----------------------------------------
Plan of Action: 
1. build a mouseover effect that permits mouse wheel scrolling to adjust a numerical range.
2. the range is used to update a data HTML tag on the page. 
3. the data tag is checked to identify a range 
4. the range is used to highlight (add classes) to the div the user was/is hovering over.
