The purpose of the project was to build a visual push/fold range chart controlled with slider/wheel scroll event to interact with the chart to study tournament poker.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Throughout the project I explored the use of Sass as a CSS preprocessor and programming using JS object orientation.
